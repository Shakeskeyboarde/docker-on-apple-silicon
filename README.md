# Docker on Apple silicon

This repository contains instructions and setup scripts for installing the Docker client (CLI) locally, the Docker daemon remotely (on Ubuntu), and configuring them to work together.

## 1. Acquire an Ubuntu (20.04 LTS) instance

You will need to be able to SSH into it as the root user.

I highly recommend creating a [Kamatera](https://console.kamatera.com) Type A (availability) VPS instance with at least 1GB of RAM and a 20GB disk.

## 2. Install the Docker client

## 3. Provision the Docker daemon

## 4. Profit.
